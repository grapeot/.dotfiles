## .dotfiles

This is the .dotfiles for me.

### Usage
`git clone --recursive` to your home folder, and make the symlink accordingly.

An example can be found in [debianinit](https://github.com/grapeot/debianinit), more specifically, [here](https://github.com/grapeot/DebianInit/blob/master/setup.sh#L17).
